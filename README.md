## 🏋️ BFT Scoring System

The BFT percentage calculation follows this logic:

### Passing Mark (60%)

- **60% baseline**: This is the minimum score to "pass" the BFT test
- For each exercise, the pass mark represents 60% achievement

### Scoring Formula

#### Push-ups & Sit-ups

```Percentage = 60 + (Your Score - Pass Mark Score)
Capped at: 0% minimum, 100% maximum
```

**Example:**

- Pass mark push-ups: 42
- Your push-ups: 50
- Your percentage: 60 + (50 - 42) = **68%**

#### Running (3.2 km)

```Percentage = 60 + (Seconds Saved / 60) × 10
```

**Example:**

- Pass mark time: 15:54 (954 seconds)
- Your time: 14:54 (894 seconds)
- Seconds saved: 60 seconds
- Your percentage: 60 + (60 / 60) × 10 = **70%**

### Final Score

```Average Percentage = (Push-ups % + Sit-ups % + Running %) / 3
```
